Problems picked from here - https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

## Beginner

> Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n.

Example: User provides 6. The program would calculate the sum - `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`

## Intermediate

> Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. 

Example: The list `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` gets printed as:

```
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
```

Input could either be hard-coded, or user supplied via a file of command line, etc.

## Hard

> Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!

Example: The word `racecar` is a palindrome - so the longest palindromatic substring would be `racecar`. The word `careers` has `reer` in it as its longest palindromatic substring.

Thoughts: This might be a fun algorithm to use recursion to solve.
